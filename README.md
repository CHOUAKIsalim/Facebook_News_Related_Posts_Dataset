# Facebook_News-Related_Posts_Dataset

This repository contains comprehensive dataset of news-related posts collected from 472 users based in the United States. The data covers the period between November 2020 and February 2021 and was obtained using the [CheckMyNews browser extension](https://github.com/CHOUAKIsalim/CheckMyNews)


# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of Facebook news-related posts that were filtered based on our [list of U.S.-based news sources](https://github.com/CHOUAKIsalim/US_News_Outlets_Dataset). We categorize the posts into four distinct types based on the mechanisms through which they appeared on users' feeds: 


1. **Selective posts**: These posts are shared by Facebook pages associated with news sources that users actively follow. Users have control over whether they receive content from these pages, and they can choose to subscribe or unsubscribe accordingly.
2. **Targeted News Exposure**: These posts are part of targeted advertising campaigns, where specific audiences are shown news-related content based on their characteristics or interests. Advertisers use targeting mechanisms to ensure that these posts reach their intended audience.
3. **Algorithmic News Exposure**: These posts are personalized "Suggested for You" posts generated by Facebook's algorithms. The algorithms consider users' previous engagement and behavior on the platform to determine which news-related posts are likely to be relevant and of interest to them.
4. **Incidental News Exposure**: These posts are received by users without them actively following the news source and without specific targeting or suggestion by Facebook. This category includes posts shared by friends, groups, and random pages that users follow.
